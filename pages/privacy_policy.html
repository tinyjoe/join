        <h3>Introduction and overview</h3>
        <p class="copy-text">
          We have prepared this privacy policy (version 16 November 2024-312908611) to explain to you, in accordance with the requirements of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=DE&amp;tid=312908611#d1e2269-1-1" target="_blank"></a>
          General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 </a> and applicable national laws, which personal data (data for short) we as the controller - and the processors (e.g. providers) commissioned by us - process, will process in the future and what lawful options you have. The terms used are to be understood as gender-neutral.
          <br><br>
          In short, we provide you with comprehensive information about the data we process about you.          
          <br><br>
          Data protection declarations usually sound very technical and use legal jargon. This privacy policy, on the other hand, is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. Where it is conducive to transparency, technical <strong>terms are explained in a reader-friendly way</strong>, links to further information are provided and graphics are used. We thus inform you in clear and simple language that we only process personal data as part of our business activities if there is a corresponding legal basis. This is certainly not possible by providing explanations that are as concise, unclear and legal-technical as possible, as is often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative and perhaps there is one or two pieces of information that you did not yet know.
          <br><br>
          If you still have any questions, we would ask you to contact the responsible body named below or in the legal notice, to follow the links provided and to look at further information on third-party websites. Our contact details can of course also be found in the legal notice.

        <h3>Scope of application</h3>
        <p class="copy-text">
          This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by us in the company and to all personal data processed by companies commissioned by us (processors). By personal data, we mean information within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as a person's name, email address and postal address. The processing of personal data ensures that we can offer and invoice our services and products, whether online or offline. The scope of this privacy policy includes
        </p>
        <ul  class="copy-text">
          <li>
            all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate
          </li>
          <li>
            Social media presences and email communication
          </li>
          <li>
            mobile apps for smartphones and other devices
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="copy-text">
          <strong>Kurz gesagt:</strong>, the privacy policy applies to all areas in which personal data is processed in the company in a structured manner via the channels mentioned. If we enter into legal relationships with you outside of these channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.

          Legal basis
        </h3>
        <p class="copy-text">
          In the following privacy policy, we provide you with transparent information on the legal principles and regulations, i.e. the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which enable us to process personal data.
          <br><br>
          As far as EU law is concerned, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016, which you can of course read online at EUR-Lex, the gateway to EU law, at
          <a

          >.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          We only process your data if at least one of the following conditions applies:
        </p>
        <ol class="copy-text">
          <li>
            <strong>Consent</strong> (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR): You have given us your consent to process data for a specific purpose. An example would be the storage of your data entered in a contact form.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contract</strong> (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR): In order to fulfil a contract or pre-contractual obligations with you, we process your data.For example, if we conclude a purchase contract with you, we need personal information in advance.
          <li>
            <strong>Legal obligation</strong>
            (Article 6(1)(c) GDPR): If we are subject to a legal obligation, we process your data. For example, we are legally obliged to keep invoices for accounting purposes. These usually contain personal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legitimate interests</strong>
            (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR): In the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your fundamental rights, we reserve the right to process personal data. For example, we need to process certain data in order to operate our website securely and efficiently. This processing is therefore a legitimate interest.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Other conditions such as the fulfilment of public interest missions and the exercise of official authority as well as the protection of vital interests do not generally apply to us. If such a legal basis is relevant, it will be indicated at the appropriate point.
        <p class="copy-text">
          In addition to the EU Regulation, national laws also apply:
        </p>
        <ul class="copy-text">
          <li>
            In <strong>Austria</strong>, this is the Federal Act on the Protection of Natural Persons with regard to the Processing of Personal Data (Data Protection Act), or DSG for short.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <strong>Germany</strong>, the Federal Data Protection Act( BDSG) applies.
          </li>
        </ul>

          If other regional or national laws apply, we will inform you about them in the following sections.

        <h3>Storage period</h3>
        <p class="copy-text">
          It is a general criterion for us that we only store personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products. This means that we delete personal data as soon as the reason for the data processing no longer exists. In some cases, we are legally obliged to store certain data even after the original purpose has ceased to exist, for example for accounting purposes.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          If you wish your data to be deleted or revoke your consent to data processing, the data will be deleted as quickly as possible, provided there is no obligation to store it.

          We will inform you below about the specific duration of the respective data processing if we have further information on this.

          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            According to Article 18 GDPR, you have the right to restriction of processing, which means that we may only store the data but not use it any further.

                If the processing of your data is based on Article 6(1)(e) (public interest, exercise of official authority) or Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interest), you can object to the processing. We will then check as quickly as possible whether we can legally honour this objection.
              </li>
              <li>
                If data is used for direct marketing purposes, you can object to this type of data processing at any time. We may then no longer use your data for direct marketing.

        <h3>Security of data processing
        </h3>
        <p class="copy-text">
          We have implemented both technical and organisational measures to protect personal data. Where possible, we encrypt or pseudonymise personal data. In this way, we make it as difficult as possible for third parties to infer personal information from our data.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Art. 25 GDPR refers to 'data protection by design and by default', meaning that we always think about security and take appropriate measures for both software (e.g. forms) and hardware (e.g. access to the server room). If necessary, we will go into more detail on specific measures below.

        <h3>
          TLS encryption with https
        </h3>
        <p class="copy-text">
          TLS, encryption and https sound very technical - and they are. We use HTTPS (the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure stands for 'secure hypertext transfer protocol') to transmit data tap-proof on the Internet. This means that the complete transmission of all data from your browser to our web server is secured - nobody can 'eavesdrop'.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          We have thus introduced an additional layer of security and fulfil data protection by design (<a
            href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=DE&amp;tid=312908611"

            rel="noopener"
            >Article 25(1) GDPR</a
          >). By using TLS (Transport Layer Security), an encryption protocol for secure data transmission on the Internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential data.<br> <br>
          You can recognise the use of this data transmission security by the small lock symbol at the top left of the browser, to the left of the Internet address (e.g. examplepage.com) and the use of the https scheme (instead of http) as part of our Internet address.<br><br>
          If you would like to know more about encryption, we recommend a Google search for 'Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure wiki' to obtain good links to further information.

        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p class="copy-text">
          When you contact us and communicate by telephone, e-mail or online form, personal data may be processed.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          The data is processed for the handling and processing of your enquiry and the associated business transaction. The data will be stored for as long as required by law.

        <br>
        <h4>Telephone</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          When you call us, the call data is stored pseudonymised on the respective end device and with the telecommunications provider used. In addition, data such as name and telephone number may subsequently be sent by e-mail and stored for the purpose of responding to enquiries. The data will be deleted as soon as the business transaction has been completed and legal requirements permit.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>E-mail</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          If you communicate with us by email, data may be stored on the respective end device (computer, laptop, smartphone, etc.) and data may be stored on the email server. The data is deleted as soon as the business transaction has been completed and legal requirements permit.

        <br>
        <h4>Online forms</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          When you communicate with us using an online form, data is stored on our web server and may be forwarded to one of our e-mail addresses. The data will be deleted as soon as the business transaction has been completed and legal requirements permit.

          The processing of data is based on the following legal bases:
        </p>
        <ul class="copy-text">
          <li>
            Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent): You give us your consent to store your data and to continue to use it for purposes relating to the business transaction;
          </li>
          <li>
            Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR (contract): There is a need for the fulfilment of a contract with you or a processor such as the telephone provider or we need to process the data for pre-contractual activities, such as the preparation of an offer;
          </li>
          <li>
            Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests): We want to handle customer enquiries and business communication in a professional manner. This requires certain technical facilities such as email programmes, exchange servers and mobile network operators in order to operate communication efficiently.

          Data processing agreement (DPA)
        </h3>
        <p class="copy-text">
          In this section, we would like to explain what an order processing contract is and why it is needed. Because the word ‘data processing agreement’ is quite a mouthful, we will often only use the acronym DPA in this text. Like most companies, we do not work alone, but also utilise the services of other companies or individuals.  By involving various companies or service providers, we may pass on personal data for processing. These partners then act as processors with whom we conclude a contract, the so-called data processing agreement (DPA). The most important thing for you to know is that the processing of your personal data takes place exclusively in accordance with our instructions and must be regulated by the DPA.
        </p>
        <h4>Who are processors?</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          As a company and website owner, we are responsible for all data that we process from you. In addition to controllers, there may also be so-called processors. This includes any company or person who processes personal data on our behalf. More precisely and according to the GDPR definition: any natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body that processes personal data on our behalf is considered a processor. Processors can therefore be service providers such as hosting or cloud providers, payment or newsletter providers or large companies such as Google or Microsoft.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          To make the terminology easier to understand, here is an overview of the three roles in the GDPR
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Data subject (you as a customer or interested party) → Controller (we as a company and client) → Processor (service provider such as a web host or cloud provider)

          One thing cannot be denied: Cookies are really useful little helpers. Almost all websites use cookies. More precisely, they are HTTP cookies, as there are also other cookies for other areas of application. HTTP cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by our website. These cookie files are automatically stored in the cookie folder, the ‘brain’ of your browser, so to speak. A cookie consists of a name and a value. When defining a cookie, one or more attributes must also be specified.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Cookies store certain user data about you, such as language or personal page settings. When you visit our site again, your browser transmits the ‘user-related’ information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are used to. In some browsers, each cookie has its own file; in others, such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in a single file.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our website, third-party cookies are created by partner websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Each cookie must be evaluated individually, as each cookie stores different data. The expiry time of a cookie also varies from a few minutes to a few years. Cookies are not software programmes and do not contain viruses, Trojans or other ‘malware’. Cookies also cannot access information on your PC.
        </p>
        <h4>Purpose of processing via cookies</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          The purpose ultimately depends on the cookie in question. You can find more details on this below or from the manufacturer of the software that sets the cookie.
        </p>
        <h4>What data is processed?</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Cookies are little helpers for many different tasks. Unfortunately, it is not possible to generalise which data is stored in cookies, but we will inform you about the processed or stored data in the following privacy policy.
        </p>
        <h4>Storage duration of cookies</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          The storage period depends on the cookie in question and is specified below. Some cookies are deleted after less than an hour, others can remain stored on a computer for several years.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          You can also influence the storage period yourself. You can delete all cookies manually at any time via your browser (see also ‘Right to object’ below). Furthermore, cookies that are based on consent will be deleted at the latest after you withdraw your consent, whereby the legality of the storage remains unaffected until then.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Right to object - how can I delete cookies?
        </h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          You decide how and whether you want to use cookies. Regardless of which service or website the cookies originate from, you always have the option of deleting, deactivating or only partially authorising cookies. For example, you can block third-party cookies but allow all other cookies.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          If you do not want to have any cookies, you can set up your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie is to be set. You can then decide for each individual cookie whether or not to allow it. The procedure differs depending on the browser. It is best to search for the instructions in Google using the search term ‘delete cookies Chrome’ or ‘deactivate cookies Chrome’ in the case of a Chrome browser.
        </p>
        <h4>Legal basis</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          The so-called ‘cookie guidelines’ have been in place since 2009. This states that the storage of cookies requires your consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR). However, there are still very different reactions to these directives within the EU countries. In Austria, however, this directive was implemented in Section 165 (3) of the Telecommunications Act (2021). In Germany, the cookie directives have not been implemented as national law. Instead, this directive was largely implemented in Section 15 (3) of the Telemedia Act (TMG), which has been replaced by the Digital Services Act (DDG) since May 2024.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          For strictly necessary cookies, even if no consent has been given, there are legitimate interests (Article 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR), which in most cases are of an economic nature. We want to provide visitors to the website with a pleasant user experience and certain cookies are often absolutely necessary for this.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          If cookies that are not absolutely necessary are used, this will only take place with your consent. The legal basis in this respect is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.

        <h3>Customer data</h3>
        <h4>What is customer data?</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          We also process data from our customers and business partners so that we can offer our services and contractual services. This data always includes personal data. Customer data is all information that is processed on the basis of a contractual or pre-contractual collaboration in order to be able to provide the services offered. Customer data is therefore all the information we collect and process about our customers.
        </p>
        <h4>Why do we process customer data?</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          There are many reasons why we collect and process customer data. The most important is that we simply need various data to provide our services. Sometimes your e-mail address is enough, but if you purchase a product or service, for example, we also need data such as your name, address, bank details or contract data. We also use the data for marketing and sales optimisation so that we can improve our overall service for our customers. Another important point is our customer service, which is always very important to us. We want you to be able to contact us at any time with questions about our offers, and for this we need at least your e-mail address.
        </p>
        <h4>What data is processed?</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">The exact data that is stored can only be described here in categories. This always depends on which services you receive from us. In some cases, you only give us your e-mail address so that we can contact you or answer your questions, for example. In other cases, you purchase a product or service from us and we require significantly more information, such as your contact details, payment details and contract details.</p>
        <h4>
          How long is the data stored?
        </h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          As soon as we no longer need the customer data to fulfil our contractual obligations and our purposes and the data is also no longer required for possible warranty and liability obligations, we delete the corresponding customer data. This is the case, for example, when a business contract ends. After this, the limitation period is generally 3 years, although longer periods are possible in individual cases. Of course, we also comply with the statutory retention obligations. Your customer data will certainly not be passed on to third parties unless you have given your explicit consent.
        </p>
        <h4>Legal basis</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR (consent), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR (contract or pre-contractual measures), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests) and in special cases (e.g. for medical services) Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a. GDPR (processing of special categories).
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          In the case of the protection of vital interests, data processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 9 para. 2 lit. c. GDPR. For the purposes of health care, occupational medicine, medical diagnosis, health or social care or treatment or for the management of health or social care systems and services, the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with Art. 9 para. 2 lit. h. GDPR. GDPR. If you voluntarily provide data of special categories, the processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a. GDPR.
          Verarbeitung auf Grundlage von Art. 9 Abs. 2 lit. a. DSGVO.

        <h3>Registration</h3>
        <p class="copy-text">When you register with us, personal data may be processed if you enter personal data or data such as the IP address is collected in the course of processing. You can read below what we mean by the rather unwieldy term ‘personal data’.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">Please only enter data that we require for registration and for which you have the authorisation of a third party if you are registering on behalf of a third party. If possible, use a secure password that you do not use anywhere else and an e-mail address that you check regularly.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">In the following we inform you about the exact type of data processing, because we want you to feel comfortable with us!
        </p>
        <h4>What is registration?</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">When you register, we collect certain data from you and enable you to log in to us online later and use your account with us. The advantage of having an account with us is that you don't have to re-enter everything every time. Saves time, effort and ultimately prevents errors in the provision of our services.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Why do we process personal data?
        </h4>
        <p class="copy-text">In short, we process personal data to enable you to create and use an account with us. <br><br>If we didn't do this, you would have to enter all the data every time, wait for us to authorise it and enter it all again. We and many, many customers would not like that. What would you think?
        </p>
        <h4>What data is processed?</h4>
        <p>All the data you entered during registration, when you logged in or when you managed your data in your account.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">When registering, we process the data you provide during registration, such as username and password, as well as data collected in the background, such as device information and IP addresses.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">During account usage, we process data that you enter while using your account and data generated in the course of using our services.
        </p>
        <h4>Retention Period</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          We store the data entered for at least as long as the associated account with us exists and is used, as long as contractual obligations between us exist, and, when the contract ends, until the respective claims arising from it are time-barred. Additionally, we retain your data for as long as and to the extent we are legally required to do so. Afterward, we keep contract-related booking records (invoices, contract documents, account statements, etc.) and other relevant business documents for the legally prescribed duration (typically several years).
        </p>
        <h4>Right to Object</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">Have you registered, entered data, and now wish to withdraw your consent to processing? No problem. As mentioned above, your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) remain applicable during and after registration, login, or account usage with us. Contact the data protection officer mentioned above to exercise your rights. If you already have an account with us, you can easily view and manage your data and entries directly in your account.
        </p>
        <h4>Legal Basis</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">By completing the registration process, you approach us with the intent to enter into a pre-contractual agreement to use our platform (although this does not automatically create a payment obligation). You invest time to enter data and register, and we provide you with our services after registration in our system and access to your customer account. Additionally, we fulfill our contractual obligations. Finally, we are required to keep registered users informed about significant changes via email. Thus, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (performance of pre-contractual measures, fulfillment of a contract) applies.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          We may also obtain your consent, for example, if you voluntarily provide more data than absolutely necessary or if we are allowed to send you advertisements. In this case, Article 6(1)(a) GDPR (consent) applies.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Furthermore, we have a legitimate interest in knowing who we are dealing with, so we can contact you in certain cases. We also need to know who is using our services and whether they are being used in accordance with our terms of use. Therefore, Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests) applies.
        </p>

        <div>
        <h3>Cloud-services</h3>
        <h4>What Are Cloud Services?</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Cloud services provide us, as website operators, with storage space and computing power via the internet. Through the internet, data can be transferred to an external system, processed, and stored. The management of this data is handled by the respective cloud provider. Depending on the requirements, an individual or a company can choose the storage capacity or computing power needed. Access to cloud storage is facilitated via an API or storage protocols. API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a programming interface that connects software components with hardware components.
        </p>
        <h4>Why Do We Use Cloud Services?</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          We use cloud services for several reasons. A cloud service enables us to securely store our data. Additionally, it allows us to access the data from various locations and devices, providing greater flexibility and streamlining our workflows. A cloud storage system also saves us costs, as we do not need to establish and maintain our own infrastructure for data storage and security. Centralizing our data storage in the cloud also helps us expand our applications and manage our information more efficiently.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          As website operators or as a company, we primarily use cloud services for our own purposes. For example, we use these services to manage our calendar or store documents and other important information in the cloud. However, this can also involve the storage of personal data provided by you. This could happen, for instance, if you share your contact information (such as your name and email address) with us, and we store our customer data with a cloud provider. Consequently, the data we process from you may also be stored and processed on external servers. If we offer specific forms or content from cloud services on our website, cookies for web analysis and advertising purposes may also be set. Such cookies may remember your preferences (e.g., your preferred language) to ensure you find your usual web environment when you visit our website again.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What Data Is Processed by Cloud Services?
        </h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Many of the data we store in the cloud is non-personal; however, some data qualifies as personal data under the GDPR. This often includes customer data such as names, addresses, IP addresses, or phone numbers, as well as technical device information. The cloud can also store videos, images, and audio files. The exact way in which data is collected and stored depends on the specific service used. We strive to use only services that handle data in a trustworthy and professional manner.<br><br>
          In general, services such as Amazon Drive have access to stored files to provide their services effectively. To do so, these services require permissions, such as the right to copy files for security purposes. These data are processed and managed within the scope of the services provided and in compliance with applicable laws, including the GDPR for US-based providers (via standard contractual clauses). In some cases, these cloud services also collaborate with third parties who process data under instructions and in compliance with data protection policies and additional security measures.
          <br><br>
          We want to emphasize that all well-known cloud services (such as Amazon Drive, Google Drive, or Microsoft OneDrive) reserve the right to access stored content to offer and optimize their services effectively.
        </p>
        <h4>Duration of Data Processing</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          We provide information about the duration of data processing further below if we have additional details on this. In general, cloud services store data until you or we revoke the data storage or delete the data. Personal data is usually retained only for as long as it is absolutely necessary to provide the services. However, final deletion of data from the cloud may take several months. This is because data is often not stored on a single server but distributed across multiple servers.
        </p>
        <h4>Right to Object</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          You have the right and the option to withdraw your consent to data storage in a cloud at any time. If cookies are used, you also have the right to withdraw consent in this context. This can be done either through our cookie management tool or other opt-out mechanisms. For example, you can prevent data collection via cookies by managing, disabling, or deleting cookies in your browser. We also recommend reviewing our general privacy policy regarding cookies. To find out precisely which data of yours is stored and processed, you should read the privacy policies of the respective cloud providers.
        </p>
        <h4>Legal Basis</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          We primarily use cloud services based on our legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) in maintaining a secure and reliable storage system.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Certain processing activities, particularly the use of cookies and storage functions, require your consent. If you have consented to your data being processed and stored by cloud services, this consent serves as the legal basis for data processing (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR). Most of the services we use place cookies in your browser to store data. Therefore, we recommend carefully reading our privacy policy on cookies as well as the privacy statements or cookie policies of the respective service providers.

          Google Fonts Privacy Policy
        </h3>
        <h4>What Are Google Fonts?</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          We use Google Fonts on our website. These are the “Google Fonts” provided by Google Inc. For users in the European region, Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Using Google Fonts does not require you to sign in or provide a password. Additionally, no cookies are stored in your browser. The files (CSS, fonts) are requested via the Google domains fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com. According to Google, these requests for CSS and fonts are completely separate from other Google services. If you have a Google account, you do not need to worry that your Google account information will be transmitted to Google while using Google Fonts. Google collects data on the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and the fonts used and stores this information securely. We will further explore the details of how this data is stored.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Google Fonts (formerly Google Web Fonts) is a directory of over 800 fonts that Google provides free of charge to its users. Many of these fonts are published under the SIL Open Font License, while others are released under the Apache License—both of which are free software licenses.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Why Do We Use Google Fonts on Our Website?
        </h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Google Fonts allow us to use fonts on our website without having to upload them to our own server. Google Fonts is a vital component for maintaining the quality of our website. All Google fonts are automatically optimized for the web, saving data volume and providing a significant advantage for mobile devices.<br><br>
          When you visit our website, the small file size ensures fast loading times. Additionally, Google Fonts are secure web fonts. Various rendering systems in different browsers, operating systems, and mobile devices can sometimes cause errors that distort text or entire websites visually. Thanks to Google Fonts' fast Content Delivery Network (CDN), there are no cross-platform issues.<br><br>
          Google Fonts supports all major browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera) and works reliably on most modern mobile operating systems, including Android 2.2+ and iOS 4.2+ (iPhone, iPad, iPod). We use Google Fonts to present our entire online service as visually appealing and consistent as possible.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What Data Does Google Store?
        </h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          When you visit our website, the fonts are reloaded from a Google server. This external request transmits data to Google’s servers. Google can thus recognize that you (or your IP address) have visited our website. The Google Fonts API is designed to minimize the collection, storage, and usage of end-user data to what is necessary for providing fonts properly. API stands for “Application Programming Interface” and serves, among other purposes, as a data transmitter in the software realm.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Google Fonts securely stores CSS and font requests with Google, ensuring they are protected. By analyzing usage data, Google can determine how well specific fonts are performing. Google publishes these results on internal analysis platforms, such as Google Analytics. Google also uses its own web crawler data to identify which websites are using Google Fonts. These findings are published in Google Fonts' BigQuery database. Businesses and developers use the BigQuery web service to analyze and manage large data sets.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          It is worth noting that every Google Fonts request automatically transmits information such as language settings, IP address, browser version, screen resolution, and browser name to Google’s servers. Whether this data is also stored is unclear and not explicitly communicated by Google.
        </p>
        <h4>
          How Long and Where Are the Data Stored?
        </h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Google stores requests for CSS assets on its servers for one day. These servers are primarily located outside the EU. This allows us to use the fonts via a Google stylesheet. A stylesheet is a template that enables quick and easy adjustments to a website’s design or font.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Font files are stored by Google for one year. Google's aim in doing so is to generally improve the loading times of websites. When millions of websites reference the same fonts, they are cached after the first visit and load instantly on subsequent visits to other sites. Occasionally, Google updates font files to reduce file size, expand language coverage, or improve design.
        </p>
        <h4>
          How Can I Delete My Data or Prevent Data Storage?
        </h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          The data stored by Google for one day or one year cannot be deleted manually. This data is automatically transmitted to Google when you visit a webpage. To delete this data prematurely, you must contact Google Support at https://support.google.com/?hl=de&tid=312908611. The only way to prevent this data storage is by not visiting our website.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Unlike other web fonts, Google allows us unrestricted access to all available fonts. This gives us access to an extensive selection of fonts, allowing us to optimize our website. For more information about Google Fonts and additional questions, please visit https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=312908611. While Google addresses some data privacy concerns there, detailed information about data storage is not provided. Obtaining precise information from Google regarding stored data can be quite challenging.
        </p>
        <h4>Legal Basis</h4>
        <p class="copy-text">
          If you have consented to the use of Google Fonts, the legal basis for the corresponding data processing is this consent. According to Article 6(1)(a) GDPR (Consent), this consent serves as the legal basis for processing personal data, as may occur when using Google Fonts.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          From our side, we also have a legitimate interest in using Google Fonts to optimize our online service. The relevant legal basis here is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (Legitimate Interests). However, we only use Google Fonts if you have provided your consent.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Google also processes your data, including in the USA. Google is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which regulates the proper and secure transfer of personal data from EU citizens to the USA. For more information, visit this link.
        </p>
        <p class="copy-text">
          Additionally, Google uses Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as defined in Article 46(2) and (3) GDPR. These templates, provided by the European Commission, aim to ensure that your data meets European data protection standards, even when transferred to and stored in third countries, such as the USA. Through the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the SCCs, Google commits to adhering to European data protection standards when processing your relevant data, even if the data is stored, processed, or managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementation decision by the European Commission. You can find the decision and the corresponding Standard Contractual Clauses here: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?locale=de.

          On our website, we use Google Fonts provided by Google Inc. For the European region, Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible. We have integrated the Google fonts locally, meaning they are stored on our web server and not on Google’s servers.

          Congratulations! If you are reading these lines, you’ve truly “made it through” our entire privacy policy—or at least scrolled down to this point. As you can see from the length of our privacy policy, we take the protection of your personal data very seriously.<br><br>
          Our goal is to inform you to the best of our ability about how personal data is processed. We don’t just want to tell you what data is processed but also explain the reasons for using various software programs. Privacy policies often sound very technical and legalistic. However, since most of you are neither web developers nor legal experts, we wanted to take a different approach and explain the matter in simple and clear language. Of course, given the nature of the topic, this is not always possible. Therefore, key terms are explained in more detail at the end of the privacy policy.<br><br>
          If you have any questions regarding data protection on our website, please do not hesitate to contact us or the responsible entity. We wish you a pleasant time and hope to welcome you back to our website soon.
